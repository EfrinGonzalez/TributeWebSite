        <p><h2>Bridges</h2> <br>
        A new wave of music and dance styles—Latin jazz, the mambo,
        and the cha cha chá—sweep across the nation from New York City
        to San Francisco. Latin music influences rock and roll and
        rhythm and blues through the 1960s.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h2>Latin Jazz (Afro-Cuban Jazz)</h2><br>
            In the 1940s, Cuban musicians living in New York City
            performed with renowned African American bandleaders
            such as Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie. They began
            to mix Cuban rhythms and instruments with American
            jazz riffs, creating an exciting new sound that is still
            popular today</p>

        <p><h2>Mambo and Cha Cha Chá</h2><br>
            These two styles of Cuban dance music were wildly
            popular during the 1950s and 1960s. First came the
            fast-paced mambo, the music of choice at New York
            City’s famous Palladium Ballroom. There, enthusiastic
            crowds danced to the beats of legendary bandleaders.
            Eventually mambo gave way to the slower and easierto-
            dance-to rhythms of the cha cha chá.</p>

        <p><h2>Salsa</h2> <br>
        In New York City, Puerto Rican and other
        Latino musicians blend Cuban and Puerto Rican
        rhythms with soul and jazz to create the popular
        salsa sound.


        Salsa is not only a spicy sauce. It’s also a popular
            Latin music and dance style known for its high-energy,
            hip-swaying rhythms and exciting turns. In the late
            1960s, innovative Latino musicians in New York City
            created the sound from a mix of Puerto Rican and Cuban
            rhythms, soul, and jazz. Salsa’s popularity soon spread
            to Latin America and beyond. Today, people from all
            corners of the globe move to salsa’s infectious beat.</p>
